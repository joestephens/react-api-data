# react-api-data example with Next.JS

This example demonstrates a typical SSR setup where an additional 'prerender' is being done to determine what requests will need to be made.
We use `api-data`'s `getDataFromTree` function for this.

Based on [Redux Thunk example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux-thunk).
